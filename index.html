    Olympic and World Champion figure skater Alysa Liu will take on her second Olympic games at this year's Milano Cortina Olympics.

<p> She retired after the 2022 Olympics at the age of 16, but has since returned to the ice, but on her own terms.
</p>

<p>These are some of her skating accomplishments:</p>

<ul>
    <li> <span id= 'Gold'> Gold </span> in the 2025 Boston World Championships</li> 
    <li> Sixth in the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics</li>  
    <li>  <span id= 'bronze'> Bronze </span> at the 2022 ISU World Figure Skating Championships</li>
</ul> 

She also came back with freshly dyed hair, which has gained a lot of popularity on social media within the last couple weeks.
